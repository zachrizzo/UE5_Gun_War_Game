/*
Base class that allows efficient management of interactions between the environment and the player.

The basic way of interaction is to:
- find actors with the ability to interact via Overlaps
- select the most appropriate instance
- find the correct GameplayAbility class
- and finally activate it.

Some elements are loaded asynchronously, which improves performance, but mainly in the packed game.
In the editor, the loading time of classes is much longer.
